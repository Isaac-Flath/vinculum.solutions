When people are first starting with the format there is usually some frustration figuring out how to work around this.  This guide is my resource and reference sheet to setting all of it up and I hope it helps others as well.\n\nNone of what I am doing is novel or a method I created - I am simply taking pieces from a lot of different places and consolidating it into a guide formatted in the way I like.  I will credit sources as they come up, so please check out the original content for extra details!\n\nThere's 2 main things you will need to adjust due to the no internet stipulation:\n+ Downloading and using pretrained models\n+ Installing new packages and libraries\n\n>Note:  [Follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/isaac_flath) if you want updates to the blog posts.  \n"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "# Setup"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "I this post I will be assuming that you already have the kaggle API installed.

Check out the docs for the specific library you are working in.\n\nFor example in fastai for an inference export/import:\n\n```python\nlearner = cnn_learner(dls,resnet18)\nlearn.fine_tune(3)\nlearn.export('your_dataset/model.pkl')\n```\n\nThat would then be imported using\n\n```python\nlearn = load_learner('file:///kaggle/input/fastai/model.pkl')\ndl = learn.dls.test_dl(df)\npreds - learn.get_preds(dl=dl)\n```"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "## Libraries"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "To download a library you can use `pip download`.  If you download it to the dataset folder you created, you can update the dataset with the instructions above.  We'll download fastai in this example so we can update to the latest version, but the same thing applies with libraries not installed at all in the kernel\n\n```bash\n!pip download fastai -d ./your_dataset/```\n\nthen you can install in the kaggle kernal like this:\n\n```bash\n!pip install -Uqq fastai --no-index --find-links=file:///kaggle/input/your_dataset/\n```\nand then import is as normal\n\n```python \nfrom fastai.vision.all import *```\n"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ">Note: Credit for these instructions goes to [samuelepino's kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/samuelepino/pip-installing-packages-with-no-internet)"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "# Conclusion\n\nIf there's anything you do that's missing or you would like added please let me know via comment or twitter.
